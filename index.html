			<h2 style="text-transform:capitalize;">Bash Scripting</h2>
			<h3>Introduction</h3>

            <p>This tutorial will give you a solid platform in how to create bash scripts and automate day to
				day system admin tasks. Certainly, everything cannot be covered in this chapter but you will
				be equipped with right amount of knowledge to make your own scripts and excel in it if you
				put in your own efforts.
				Bash scripting is used by many of the system admins and DevOps geeks to get things done
				quickly and efficiently. There are so many automation tools in the market like Ansible, Puppet,
				Chef etc. Which are way more sophisticated but sometimes to get things done quickly in Linux
				systems we use Bash scripts. Also, scripting will make you understand what automation
				means and then you can quickly grasp the features that is used in Configuration Management
				tools like Ansible or puppet.

		   <h4>What are scripts?</h4>	
		     <p>A Bash script is a plain text file which contains a series of commands. These commands are a
				mixture of commands we would normally type ourselves on the command line (such as ls or
				cp for example) and commands we could type on the command line but generally wouldn't
				(you'll discover these over the next few pages). A crucial point to remember though is:
			</p>
			 <p style="font-weight:bold;">Anything you can run normally on the command line can be put into a script and it
				will do exactly the same thing. Similarly, anything you can put into a script can also
				be run normally on the command line and it will do exactly the same thing.</p>
				
			<h4>First Script</h4>
			<p>As we discussed earlier that script is a normal text file with commands in it.
					We will open a file vi editor and add some commands in it.
					It is convention to give files that are Bash scripts an extension of .sh (print.sh for example)
			</p>
			<p class="bg-silver">$ vi print.sh <br><br>

	                1. #!/bin/bash<br>
					2. # A sample Bash script<br>
					3. echo Hello World!<br>
	            
       		 </p>
			<p>Explanation:</p>	

			<p style="font-weight:bold">Line 1:</p>
			<p>#! is called as the SHEBANG character, it tells the script to interpret the rest of the
				lines with an Interpreter /bin/bash. So, if we change that to /usr/bin/python then it tells the
				script to use python interpreter.
			</p>
			<p style="font-weight:bold">Line 2:</p>
			<p>This is a comment. Anything after # is not executed. It is for our reference only.
               Comments is for us so or anybody who reads this script will have some reference.
			</p>
			<p style="font-weight:bold">Line 3:</p>
			<p>Is the command echo which will print a message to the screen. You can type this
               command yourself on the command line and it will behave exactly the same.
